## Postmortem: The Great Database Caper of 2023

### Issue Summary

- **Duration of the Outage:** October 5, 2023, 14:00 to 16:30 UTC (2 hours and 30 minutes)
- **Impact:** The web service decided to take a very extended coffee break, affecting around 75% of users. Symptoms included unbearably slow page loads, failed logins, and an outright refusal to cooperate. Think snail’s pace, but internet edition. 
- **Root Cause:** Our database objected to working without the proper index, much like a librarian trying to find a book in an un-indexed library. This resulted in high CPU overloads and equally high levels of frustration.

### Timeline

- **14:05** - Issue detected by our stellar automated monitoring alert. Kudos AlertBot!
- **14:10** - Alert acknowledged by our unsung hero, the on-call engineer (we’ll call him Bob).
- **14:15** - Bob embarks on an initial investigation; web server logs are as useful as a chocolate teapot.
- **14:25** - Web server configuration suspected (remember, Bob is just following instinct here). Cache settings adjusted – no dice.
- **14:40** - Bob notices the database server is hitting the gym too hard (high CPU usage).
- **15:00** - Bob rings the alarm; database team swoops in.
- **15:15** - Database sleuths reveal the mystery – missing index on the `orders` table.
- **15:25** - Index creation kicks off (cue epic build-up music).
- **16:15** - Index creation complete; service performance stabilizes faster than you can say "SQL.”
- **16:30** - Full service restoration confirmed. Party poppers all around!

### Root Cause and Resolution

#### Root Cause

Our devoted `orders` table was missing a crucial index on the `order_date` column, akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack. This resulted in full table scans that exercised our CPU more than a marathon. Naturally, this bottleneck resulted in slow queries, high CPU usage, and, ultimately, widespread application slowdowns.

#### Resolution

Fear not! Our heroic database team jumped in:

1. **Identifying the issue:** Sherlock Holmes-style detective work discovered the missing index.
2. **Implementing the fix:** An index on the `order_date` column was created faster than you can upside-down your laptop looking for the escape key.
3. **Verifying the results:** Monitored the system performance, and lo and behold, the speed was reborn, restoring our faith in SQL.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

To tame the wild world of our database and ensure we never face such temper tantrums again, we shall implement the following measures:

1. **Improve Database Monitoring:**
   - **Granular monitoring on query performance** to catch slow queries before they catch us.
   - **Regular alerts on unusual database CPU usage** to keep our CPU zen-like calm.

2. **Code and Deployment Reviews:**
   - **Rigorous schema change reviews** because we missed being Sherlock the first time.
   - **Automate performance testing** to catch sneaky performance hitches in staging.

3. **System Capacity Planning:**
   - **Regular review and update of capacity planning** - Keep the database server robust and well-prepped like a marathon runner.

#### Specific Action Items:

- [ ] **Patch Nginx server** with better caching strategies – make sure our servers are as chill as they can be.
- [ ] **Add detailed monitoring on server memory and CPU usage** to ensure swift alerts and responses.
- [ ] **Review and update database schema change process** with mandatory performance test requirements.
- [ ] **Create a no-missing-index checklist** for database evaluations to avoid such oversight.
- [ ] **Host developer training sessions** on SQL optimization – let’s all be data ninjas!

### Conclusion

By combining humor, vigilance, and a dash of technical prowess, we’ve survived the Great Database Caper of 2023. With these corrective measures in place, we aim for a future where our services run smoother than butter on hot toast. Thanks for reading – keep calm and monitor on!
